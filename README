This is my exploration of programming without the C Standard library.

Essentially starting with the instructions posted here:
http://weeb.ddns.net/0/programming/c_without_standard_library_linux.txt

Much of the code began transcribed from the above link, which contains
no license information, but is clearly designed as a tutorial to build
upon. My work, which builds upon that is aiming to go in another
direction, specifically, I'd like to be able to implement more of libc
the standard library, especially for embedded systems. My additions will
be LGPLv2+. We'll see where it goes.
